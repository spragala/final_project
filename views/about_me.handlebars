        I am passionate about helping people work towards positive change.  I use a relational approach, warmth, and humor in session in order to help clients shift patterns and create lives that they find rich and meaningful.
        <br><br>
        I received my Masters in Social Welfare from UCLA and have been practicing in the Bay Area since 2014.
